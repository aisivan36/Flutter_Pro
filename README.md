# Flutter Pro Re-fresh

A new Flutter project.
This is a learing project which has so many explanation for myself in the future. I may end up with so many things which can easily forget all of them, that's why I created this to remember what things that should I remember.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
